# PI laboratory in VB6

A sequence of digits that never ends and that never exhibits patterns is scratchy for any questioning mind. The main question in regard to this project is: Are there patterns in the digits of irrational numbers? PI laboratory tries to show patterns in the digits of irrational numbers, in a graphical manner. PI, e, Ratio, or Sqrt(2) are some of the numbers taken into consideration. Each sequence of digits has a length of 10,000 digits. The application treats these sequences of digits as signals (10,000 digits for each - PI, e, Ratio, or Sqrt(2)). The heatmap shown in the graphical interface represents a transition matrix in which the probability of transition between digits is signified by colors. Bright red is 1 and black is 0. Below the heatmap is a graph showing the frequency of digits (0-9) in a sliding window above the sequence of digits.
