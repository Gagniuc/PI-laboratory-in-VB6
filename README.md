# PI laboratory in VB6

A sequence of digits that never ends and that never exhibits patterns is scratchy for any questioning mind. The main question in regard to this project is: Are there patterns in the digits of irrational numbers? PI laboratory tries to show patterns in the digits of irrational numbers, in a graphical manner. PI, e, Ratio, or Sqrt(2) are some of the numbers taken into consideration. Each sequence of digits has a length of 10,000 digits. The application treats these sequences of digits as signals. The heatmap shown in the graphical interface represents a transition matrix in which the probability of transition between digits is signified by colors. Bright red is 1 and black is 0. Below the heatmap is a graph showing the frequency of digits (0-9) in a sliding window above the sequence of digits. Below the last graph is another graph showing the frequency of digits on all processed sliding windows. This is important as it appears that the frequencies of the digits increase one by one, in the sense that the frequency of one digit has a steep increase and the frequency of other digits remain temporarily unchanged, after a while the frequency of another digit increases and the others remain unchanged, and so on.
